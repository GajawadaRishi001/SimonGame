# SimonGame
Welcome to the Simon Game! This is a digital version of the classic memory game "Simon." Test your memory skills and see how far you can go by repeating the increasingly complex pattern of lights and sounds.

# How to Play
Gameplay Area: You will see four colored buttons, each representing a different sound and color: Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow.

Game Start: Press the "Start" button to begin the game. Simon will play the first color in the pattern.

Follow the Pattern: Repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the same order that Simon played them. Each time you successfully repeat the pattern, Simon will add a new color to the end of the sequence.

Winning: Keep following the pattern correctly to advance in levels. The game continues until you make a mistake by clicking the wrong color.

Mistake: If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can choose to start over by pressing the "Start" button.
